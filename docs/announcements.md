# Announcements

## Week 12:
* April 4: Results for assignment 2 are now available on MarkUs. **Note:** Your actual grade is out of 41, not 54 (13 of the marks are bonus marks). See [this Piazza post](https://piazza.com/class/k4xo4w48g2u35e?cid=433) for some more information on the marking.
* April 4: [Assignment 3 sample solutions](../assignments/a3_solutions.pdf) have been posted.

* March 30: The [vote on changes to the marking scheme](https://piazza.com/class/k4xo4w48g2u35e?cid=313) has concluded after being open for 7 days.

(You can still find a link to the course information sheet with the original marking scheme on the main page.)
* March 28: Lecture slides, exercises, and a video recording have been posted (a bit early) for the final week. Note that we *will* also have a final tutorial this week.

## Week 11:
* March 26: If you previously contacted me about missing the second midterm on Monday, you should now have received an e-mail from me about the schedule for a make-up test. If you were planning on writing a make-up midterm and you did not receive an e-mail from me, **please contact me** asap.
* March 23: Assignment 3 has been posted
* March 23: A [poll on proposed changes to the marking scheme](https://piazza.com/class/k4xo4w48g2u35e?cid=313) has been posted on Piazza. These changes will take effect if they're approved by a simple majority of students. The changes include an assessment to replace the final exam, increasing the weight of some term work, and changing the way quiz grades are calculated.
* March 23: [Solutions for test 2](../misc/t2_solutions.pdf) have been posted
* March 23: [Here is a link to midterm 2](../misc/t2_compact.pdf). And [here is a link to a roomier version](../misc/t2_long.pdf) with space to write answers, if you prefer to annotate the pdf directly.

## Week 10:
* March 20: [I've posted a note to Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/k4xo4w48g2u35e?cid=273) outlining some proposed changes to the grading scheme, including an assessment to replace the final exam. I will be holding a formal vote early next week, but this is your opportunity to advocate for any modifications to my proposed changes before the vote opens.
* March 20: [Assignment 2 sample solutions](../assignments/a2_solutions.pdf) have been posted. See Piazza for some notes on these solutions.
* March 17: I've made some updates to the ["last 3 weeks"](../last3weeks) page, most importantly giving details of an **online test Monday March 23rd @ 12:00** to replace the second midterm originally scheduled for yesterday.
* March 16: Week 10 lecture recordings have been posted to the 'Lectures & Tutorials' section, alongside the lecture slides.
* March 15: [I've posted a document](../last3weeks/) outlining the changes to the format of this course for our last 3 weeks. It's long, but please read it over.

## Week 9:
* March 13: Some brief notes regarding the effect on this course of cancellation of in-person classes (stay tuned for more details, such as the delivery of lectures and tutorials going forward):
    * Term test 2 (originally scheduled for March 16) is cancelled. (A replacement assessment may be announced later.)
    * Today's tutorial and quiz will proceed as planned. Subsequent tutorials will be delivered online (with the exact details TBA).
* March 13: A copy of the formula sheet that will be given out with term test 2 has been posted to the 'Tests' section of the course website.
* March 11: Following an in-class vote, the deadline for assignment 2 has been extended to Sunday March 15th at 3pm.

## Week 8
* March 5: I will be holding extra office hours on Friday March 6 at 2pm in BA4290.
* March 4: The posted assignment 2 handout has been updated with two minor clarification:
    * Q1 parts (b) and (d): added instruction to not use the Master Theorem
    * Q3: footnote added to clarify that a precondition of maj is that it contains a majority element
* March 3: The week 8 exercises have been updated with one additional (short) question. 

## Week 7
* Feb 27: The complete assignment 2 handout has been posted to the Assignments section. I will be spending some time at the beginning of Monday's lecture going over the assignment.
* Feb 24: A1 results have been posted to MarkUs. Note that, as mentioned in lecture and on Piazza, question 2b was originally marked out of 3, but I decided to reduce its weight by half. To calculate your 'real' A1 grade, you should multiply your q2b grade by .5 and treat the assignment as being out of 31.5 instead of 33.

## Week 6.5 (Reading Week)
* Feb 18: A [sneak peek of assignment 2](../assignments/a2_preview.pdf) has been posted. The final assignment will include one additional question, and will be posted (along with starter `.tex` source) later this week.
